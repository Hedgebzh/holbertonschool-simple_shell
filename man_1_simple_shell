.SH NAME
.B Simple Shell
- command line interpreter
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B Simple Shell
.SH DESCRIPTION
Simple shell is a version of a command line interpreter that executes commands read from the standard input. It's functionality is limited to certain shell builtin functions found in the environmental variable
.I PATH.
It does not handle piping, redirection and more extra functions.
.SS Invocation
An
.I interactive
simple shell can be started by typing ./hsh. Meanwhile, a
.I non-interactive
simple shell can also be started via a pipe (e.g. echo "/bin/ls" | ./hsh).
.SS Command Execution
After a command has been split into words, if it results in a simple command and an optional list of arguments, the following actions are taken.
.sp
If the command name contains no slashes, the shell attempts to locate it. If there exists a shell function by that name that function is executed. If the name does not match a function, the shell searches for it in the list of shell builtins. If a match is found, that builtin is executed.
.sp
If the name is neither a shell function or a builtin, and contains no slashes, the simple shell searches each element of the PATH for a directory containing an executable file with that name. If the search is unsuccessful, the simple shell prints an error message "Error: File or description not found."
