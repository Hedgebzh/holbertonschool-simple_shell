## Requirements

* Compilation command: `gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh`
* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 using gcc 
* All your files should end with a new line
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
* Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
* Your shell should not have any memory leaks
* No more than 5 functions per file
* All your header files should be include guarded
* Use system calls only when you need to

## Simple Shell
> The shell is the Linux command line interpreter. It provides an interface between the user and the kernel and executes programs called commands. For example, if a user enters "ls" then the shell executes the ls command. The shell can also execute other programs such as applications, scripts, and user programs (e.g., written in c or the shell programming language).

### Synopsis

> This repository holds all the code necessary for our custom ```simple shell``` to run.
> Our shell currently handles the executions of executables found in the PATH, with or without their full paths (/bin/ls or just ls). Sample commands that our shell supports include ls, mkdir, pwd, echo, whoami, whereis, etc.


### Built-Ins

* `exit` exits shell (Usage: `exit`)
* `env` prints environmental variables (Usage: `env`)
